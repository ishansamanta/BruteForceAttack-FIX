# BruteForceAttack-FIX
A basic bruteforce attack simuation, contains the weak code which has a weak login system and my task is to fix the login system. There will be multiple files among which  one is a weak security code and the other ones will be mine which  i will update and improve the security of the login system
## AT FIRST GLANCE THE PYTHON FILE may seem like working smoothly, but contains a delicate logical flow mistake which I have to find and update it  like a security engineer.
# TARGETS:
ðŸ”§ Patch ideas: (basic level )

Add cooldown feature

Allow limited unlocks after reset



## Try finding the error in logic, there is no runtime error or anything. You can also update and modify  it as per your wish. ThankYou
## WORK LOGS:
### CoolDown feature added for slowing rapid brute force attack + user data storing section added where data is stored in encrypted form + added my own algorithm as well as encoder that works on my own algorithm. <DATE : 22nd June,2025>
